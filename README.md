# udacity_map_project

This a app built for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program.

In this app users can select landmark locations on the map or from the list of landmark names. Users can also specify a particular location that they would like to see by entering it into the search box. Additionally, if you click on a marker on the map, you'll get more information about that landmark.
