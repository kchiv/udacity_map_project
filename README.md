# udacity_map_project

This app built for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program.

In this app users can select landmark locations on the map or from the list of landmark names. Users can also specify a particular location that they would like to see by entering it into the search box. Additionally, if you click on a marker on the map, you'll get more information about that landmark.
