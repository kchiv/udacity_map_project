# udacity_map_project

This app built for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program.

In this app users can select landmark locations on the map or from the list of landmark names. Users can also specify a particular location that they would like to see by entering it into the search box. Additionally, if you click on a marker on the map, you'll get more information about that landmark.

## APIs

For this project I used two Google APIs, the maps API and the knowledge graph API. Additionally, the Flickr API was used to allow more images to be viewed for each landmark.

## How to Run the App

To run the app locally, download all the files from github. Once all the files are downloaded, open the **map-project.html** file within your browser. Once this file is open in your browser, you'll be able to use the app.
